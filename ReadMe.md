## Big Bamazon!

Bamazon is a puesdo version of the well known amazon, you buy and upload products for sale, I also included 
a Manager view for you to edit whats for sale

 * first you will need to run a npm install to make this work, but you already know that
 
 * Next you need to have a working sql workbench and server I left a copy of the SQL code in the file name sql.txt
 
The following is the syntax and a GIF of how to use Bamazon, if the gif is too small theres a link at the bottom to the Full video
